# EmployeeWorkHours
GUI application that counts how much time did the employee spend in the workplace. 

There are several restrictions that have to be met in order to let the application work smoothly and realistically. 
When restrictions are not met then application prompts the user with instructions.

For example: 
  - user is not allowed to input data different than Integer (once again, the app counts spent time...)
  - user have to complete all of the fields in order to see the exact result
  - user cannot provide hour value bigger than 24 and minutes value bigger than 60  (application deals with real world time)
  
Programm is time-versatile and effectively counts provided values. Application copes with counting when provided working time is normal
and employee worked during the day and also does not disappoint when entered data says that the employee worked overnight. 

## Screenshots

This is how the App looks.
